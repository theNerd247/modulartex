<p>
	modulartex is a build system for LaTeX documents that is designed with
	modularity in mind. Most LaTeX documents are written using either a single
	document (which becomes very large and unmanageable) or with a poor directory
	hierarchy and the 
	<a href=""https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents target="_blank">
		subfiles
	</a> package. By a "poor" hierarchy I mean that the directory structure tends
	to have the main tex file and a single style file in the root of the directory
	structure and the other tex files in a subdirectory called "tex/" (or
	something of the like). 
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with this directory layout, and infact for the most
	part LaTeX does a pretty good job for modularity. However, when writing
	multiple documents that have different pieces and reuse a lot of code (such as
	a common set of images, TikZ files, other source code files, etc.) LaTeX
	doesn't provide a nice system for providing the location of documents.
</p>

<p>
	Another issue of LaTeX is liking (logically) style files with their
	corresponding tex files. Here's an example. Let's say you have a couple of
	projects with the following directory structure:

<!--

<code>
	parent_dir
		|
		|- project1/
		|		|
		|		|- main.tex
		|		|
		|		|- main.sty
		|		|
		|		|- tex/
		|		|		|- proj1.tex
		|
		|- project2/
		|		|
		|		|- main.tex
		|		|
		|		|- main.sty
		|		|
		|		|- tex/
		|		|		|- proj2.tex
</code>  -->
